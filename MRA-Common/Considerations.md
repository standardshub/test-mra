## Considerations

Big Organization :  In General , a big Organization will have mixture of Large, Mid & Small size plants. 


Where, 

Large Plant has roughly :  Machines count > 1000 

Mid-Size Plant has roughly :  1000 > Machines count > 500 

Small size Plant has roughly : Machines count < 500 


Goal : Moving from Maturity Level 1-2 to 3-4 or Moving from maturity Level 1-2 to 5-6 


Challenges : 

* How to establish a Common Org Model : Each Plant having a different structure within itself  

* General Reusability applied to specific Plants : Scalability , Adjustment & suitability of
  Components/Modules to Plant specific need  

* Deployment Topology  

* Cost Effective of Solution : Trade Off between Solution Cost vs Performance/Realtime results  

* Considering Region (local) regulations and policies , as applicable : Data considerations  

* Division of Responsibilities : What to cover by traditional systems like MES/Scada vs IIoT    
  specific Cloud or Edge Components
