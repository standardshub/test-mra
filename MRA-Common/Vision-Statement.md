## Common: Vision Statement
**Purpose - WHY [Existing in Charter]**
See Manufacturing Reference Architecture Group Charter => Working Group Scope 


_The goal of OMP is to provide an open, based on industry standards, higher-level non-committal manufacturing reference architecture, enabling companies to align their shop floor infrastructure and systems while enabling industrial solutions to integrate faster._   

  

_Therefore, the goal of this Working Group is to provide a fully scalable reference architecture blueprint to simplify deployment and management of the entire cloud and edge manufacturing environment. Across most manufacturing customers, there are several common infrastructure patterns and best practices that should be applied when architecting a scalable end-to-end solution. These patterns can be combined and applied with the necessary services to build a modular framework tailored to manufacturing. The blueprint should help manufacturers to handle complex engineering tasks, such that manufacturers are not required to build these mechanisms from the ground up._  

  

_This Working Group will ensure that artifacts provided by other working groups can be integrated easily. To achieve this, rules, guidelines & directives are provided by this working group._  

  

_The Manufacturing Reference Architecture Working Group will define architectural blueprints, diagrams, whitepapers, and descriptions demonstrating how different technological components fit together to provide a solution.  It may contain qualitative descriptions of each component as well as schematic blocks.  For example, a reference architecture component could identify and define patterns for data ingestion or deployment between the cloud and the edge.  At the same time, it may also explore new business models, such as an architectural framework to operate securely and self- sufficient on shared industrial data platforms.  The working group will embrace pre-existing open reference architectures from across the industry and will have a tight integration with the other OMP Working Groups._  

 
## Objectives - WHAT (SMART) [New]  

> Might need to link to overall defined OMP objectives.

> Need to be defined in SMART manner: 


* Scalability in Production (both up and down) 

* Standardization, Reusability and Openness 

* Interoperability, Flexibility & Agility (capacity flexibility with adaptive production building blocks) 

* Innovation Capabilities (state-of-the-art technologies) 

* Integration Capabilities (brownfield and greenfield) 

* Quality (reduction of rework minutes) 

* Technical Availability (improvement of OEE) 

* Availability of talent 

* Safety and Security 

* Reduction of Risk  

* Acceleration of Implementation  

* Cost efficiency (reduction of cost/time spent per unit) 

* Quality (reduction of rework minutes) 

* Cost efficiency (reduction of cost/time spent per unit) 


## Vision - WHAT (illustrated & summarized) [New]
 
> Short, 2-3 line sentences describing key goals in action: 

**Interoperability** - Provide a set of easy to implement building blocks / solutions for any execution environment. With a high degree of automation, you can setup any variant of an IoT Ref architecture within hours. 



**Reusability** - Ensures an effective and applicable use of technologies based on Open Standards and APIs. You can move your entire IoT architecture, or a subset, within hours to a different execution environment 



**Diversity and Inclusion** - Discover and align best practices / solutions in the manufacturing domain with the most experienced and relevant companies, partners and stakeholders. We build the new standard!

## Mission** - HOW [Existing in Charter] 


> This is somewhat defined in the Charter’s Scope, might need a higher level description instead of tactical working mode 



Possible ways to define and model the scope and vision of the WG Manufacturing Reference Architecture  

  

We see several ways to define the scope of this working group, each with different aspects and options. Some are more granular than others and some are completely optional and may become more clear when more Use Cases are elaborated. Although the final architecture should be as open and applicable as possible to the largest amount of users and companies, a certain delimitation is recommended to have a clear vision and graspable goals. 

  

The following categories of scoping options can be used for shaping the vision of our Working Group: 

  

1. Industry boundaries: For all industrial sectors or specific ones (e.g. automotive, chemical, public etc.) 

    1. All industries 

    2. Find common Use Cases 

    4. Add specifics for industries later 


2. Size limitations: Fully scalable from small, local company over medium sized ("Mittelstand") to worldwide acting enterprises 

    1. All size of companies (first: 1, Maturity level 4) 

        1. Category: (add a table -> Richa) 

            1. Global supply chain, Global production network, >100 plants, Maturity level (which one)  

            2. Align with connectivity WG – then move to next level 

            3. Need to have in mind the different level of maturity at plant (Input Richa) 



    2. Add the template 

    3. Are there specifics wrt to company size? 

    4. Architecture requirements wrt to scale up and down 

    5. Adding terms to Glossary  



3. Local boundaries: On-Prem vs Hybrid vs Cloud architecture 

    1. All of them; no boundary 

    2. Depends on use case 

    3. Depends on maturity level 

    4. Look at edge connectivity (on prem?); Data Ingest, Data Sourcing 

    5. Add to the template 

    6. Add to glossary 



4. Brownfield vs Greenfield: Focus on integration of existing legacy systems and "organically" grown infrastructure vs set up of completely new and modern asset infrastructure with new methods, protocols and technology 

    1. Focus: Brownfield 

    2. First: functional Arch (add to glossary; logical Architecture, etc...); later adding Technical Building Blocks; business process/Data Flow/what is happening / Capability Mapping  

    3. Needs to be Vendor agnostic 

    4. What does that mean for Green Field Approaches? 

5. Quality vs Quantity of Architecture(s): One single architecture consisting of different blue prints or several unique architectures for each use case 

    1. Architecture per Use Case

    2. Find patterns for Core Services / Technical Buildings Blocks (need to fit for green/Brown field) 

    3. Vision: group/bundle Use Cases for specific Challenges 



6. Concrete outcomes: Webpage as wiki, whitepaper (pdf), interactive webservice , conference presentations 

    1. Whitepaper (Business/BDM audience/Guidance/Standards/Need of doing/ Why/what/how) 

    2. How: Technical -> desc of technical parts, building blocks, Diagrams/ flows / demonstrator/ Code snippets / Arch42 / plant UML? / Archimate/ (need a diagram tool (Axel) / somebody can start a project / Execution view / HowTo  



7. Technical depth of outcome: Management summary and guidelines vs a toolbox a company's engineering staff can start right away with 

    1. BOTH! :) 

  

We are happy for feedback and open for any discussion! 

* Per Use Case: overarching Architecture -> Epics -> …. 

    * Figure out what are the core services inside? 

* Green Field / Brown Field? 

* Glossary: our own + feed the OMP glossary from time to time; who is responsible for the global one? we?

    * Wolfram: Cloud, Edge, Dimension of Architecture... 

    * Harald: Good understanding of matching Use Cases / Core Services / Functional ... 

    * Richa: will choose some topics
